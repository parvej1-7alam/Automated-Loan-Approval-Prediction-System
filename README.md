🚀 Loan Approval Prediction – Machine Learning Project
</h1>

<p align="center">
A complete end-to-end ML workflow to automate loan approval decisions using data-driven modeling.

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day.  
Manually evaluating them is **slow**, **inconsistent**, and prone to **human bias**.

This project builds a **machine learning–based loan approval prediction system** to automate the decision-making process. The model predicts whether a loan should be **Approved** or **Rejected** using demographic, financial, and credit parameters.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- ⚡ **Increase efficiency** of loan processing  
- 🎯 **Improve prediction accuracy** using ML  
- ⚖️ **Enhance fairness** with data-driven insights  
- 📊 **Identify key factors** influencing approval decisions  

---

## 🧩 **Key Features**

- Complete **data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) with visual insights  
- Feature engineering & handling missing values  
- Multiple ML models tested (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Final model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix  
- Clean, well-structured Jupyter Notebook workflow
