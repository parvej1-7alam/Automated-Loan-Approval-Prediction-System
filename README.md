 Loan Approval Prediction – Machine Learning Project
</h1>

<p align="center">
A complete end-to-end ML workflow to automate loan approval decisions using data-driven modeling.

##  **Project Overview**

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day.  
Manually evaluating them is **slow**, **inconsistent**, and prone to **human bias**.

This project builds a **machine learning–based loan approval prediction system** to automate the decision-making process. The model predicts whether a loan should be **Approved** or **Rejected** using demographic, financial, and credit parameters.

##  **Objectives**

-  **Increase efficiency** of loan processing  
-  **Improve prediction accuracy** using ML  
-  **Enhance fairness** with data-driven insights  
-  **Identify key factors** influencing approval decisions  

---

##  **Key Features**

- Complete **data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) with visual insights  
- Feature engineering & handling missing values  
- Multiple ML models tested (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Final model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix  
- Clean, well-structured Jupyter Notebook workflow

##  **Dataset Information**

The dataset includes common applicant parameters:

- Applicant Income  
- Co-Applicant Income  
- Loan Amount & Duration  
- Credit History  
- Gender, Marital Status, Dependents  
- Education Level  
- Property Area  
- Loan Approval Status (Target)

##  **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

##  **Modeling Approach**

1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
2. Encoding categorical variables  
3. Train-test split  
4. Fitting multiple ML algorithms  
5. Hyperparameter tuning  
6. Evaluating best model  
7. Interpreting model results
